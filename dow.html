            <h2>Level up your first class</h2>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy 14 provide a complete main main scenario quest to guide you to play with your first class.<br>
                    Even without preferred bonus leveling would be easy until 40lv.<br>
                    And you should follow the story line to unlock most of the playing method in this game.<br>
                    After that, you can leveling by these method following:
                </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Dungeon with players</h3>
                <p>
                    Dungeons are instanced areas teeming with enemies and bosses, fought by a party of (usually) 4 players.<br>
                    Each instance of a dungeon is separate from others and is exclusive to a specific party.<br>
                    Dungeons need to be unlocked through quests (many are unlocked as part of the main story).<br>
                    They also have level requirements (and, starting at level 50, item level requirements).<br>
                    Players below the level requirement cannot enter the dungeon.<br>
                    Players above the level requirement are level synced to the maximum level permitted for the dungeon.
                </p>
                <h3>Dungeon with adventurer squadrons</h3>
                <p>
                    Adventurer Squadrons allow players to take command of soldiers in their respective Grand Companies.
                    After assembling a sufficient number of NPC recruits,
                    players can enter dungeon alongside three of your squadron NPCs.
                    If you are leveling a DPS role, you better leveling with squadrons or enter Deep Dungeons to avoid a longer queue time.
                </p>
                <h3>Deep Dungeons</h3>
                <p>
                    After 17lv you can unlock the Deep Dungeon named The Palace of the Dead in New Gridana(x: 12.0 y:13.1).<br>
                    It is better form up a 4 players team to complete this dungeon.<br>
                    But you can also enter the dungeon yourself as a challenge.<br>
                    Another deep dungeon named Heaven-on-High can be unlock at 61lv in The Ruby Sea(x: 6.2, y:11.7).
                </p>
                <h3>F.A.T.E.</h3>
                <p>
                    Every map will trigger some F.A.T.E(Full Active Time Events).<br>
                    FATEs involve boss battles, escort missions and other events.<br>
                    Players can complete these events for experience, gil and Grand Company seals.<br>
                    Occasionally players will also receive items for successful completion of a FATE at gold medal.
                </p>
                <h3>Levemete</h3>
                <p>
                    Levemete is still a common way to leveling.<br>
                    Each time you comlpete the quest can gain various rewards.<br>
                    You can gain 3 allowances every 12 hours, and the max allowances is 100.<br>
                    Notice that you cannot accept levemete without allowance.<br>
                    In our opinion, Battle levemete is not a good option for leveling even it still an option.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary>When you reach 60lv</summary>
                    <p>
                        Beast tribes quest in 4.0 & 5.0 expension will be a way to gain some bonus experience.<br>
                        But notice that you can only complete 12 quest every day<br>
                        (Allowance reset at GMT+9 00:00 everyday)
                    </p>
                </details>
                <h2>After 70lv, two more optional method will be unlocked:</h2>
                <h3>Dungeon with specific NPCs (TRUST)</h3>
                <p>
                    The TRUST will be unlocked via main scenario quest and you can leveling with specific in-game characters.<br>
                    You can take all the loots and complete the dungeon in your own pace.
                </p>
                <h3>The Bozjan Southern Front</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bozjan Southern Front is an instanced area that up to 72 players can explore simultaneously,<br>
                    and is the first major battlefield in the Save the Queen: Blades of Gunnhildr storyline.<br>
                    It is where players assist the Bozjan Resistance in reclaiming their homeland from the IVth Imperial Legion.
